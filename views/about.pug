        p Full Stack JavaScript Developer


        .about-bio

          p Hi, I'm Jeff. Since I was a kid, I've been obsessed with computers - I would open them up, write programs, and explore all the new technologies as they popped up. Fast forward a couple decades, and all that tinkering has ended up giving me years of valuable work experience and a set of skills that I'm excited about bringing into the world of web development.
          p Prior to completing my BS in Computer Science in 2021, I used my knowledge of programming to travel the world as a concert lighting programmer and designer. I've been to 6 of the 7 continents programming lighting cues for live shows, from small clubs to huge outdoor festivals and arenas. Suffice to say, my interest in computers as a kid has given me experiences that I am very grateful for.
          p Now, I've decided to jump headfirst into the world of web development. I am on track to completing my Fullstack JavaScript TechDegree from Team Treehouse, and I have grown extremely committed to becoming a valuable asset to any company who ends up hiring me. I am confident that my drive, eagerness to learn and grow, and past work experiences make me an ideal choice for anyone to have on their team. I look forward to working and growing with you!
